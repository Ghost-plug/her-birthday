I don’t want today to be about me , or us or the past but I want to use this opportunity to first of all tell you that I’m very sorry for everything I did to you, making you a victim of something you weren’t a cause of, I take full responsibility and I apologize for it. I’m sorry for all the pain and damage I caused you, I’ve been terrible and I’m sorry. I also want to tell you thank you so much for everything you’ve done for me, you’re really the best. You’ve been supportive, loving , honest and above all very loyal and committed. I’m sorry for not being able to pay back all of that. Given the chance I would do it a hundred fold. 

I want to wish you the happiest of birthdays, I could been the first to wish you but I had your gifts sent out and decided my message will be here. I wish you all the best in life, new heights, opportunities and a great life, keep being pretty and jsyk you’re the sweetest soul I’ve ever met and the best thing to ever happen to a man. I love you, and even I don’t know how much I love you, let alone you. We were young and in love, we made mistakes, I especially, I learnt from them, I’m growing and pushing to be a better person, I know you won’t take me back, but it’s all I hope for. But all the same I want all the best for you. I love you. I love you so much that I hate myself so bad for hurting you. But let’s not get to that because it’s your birthday. I hope you have the best of days. This message is custom made and overtime you could scan the code and get a different message. I don’t want you to have a message of pain for your bday for as long as you decide to keep the gift. I love so much, my little heaven. I’m sorry I was hell to you, you were hell’s paradise and I’m grateful to you for making me see different and be different.💫❤ Happy Birthday, Little Heaven! May your day be as magical and sweet as you are 💖✨🎂`;
